# Showcase

Showcase is an iOS application that will allow you to take a picture of a textbook (or
possibly other purchasable items) and be able to view the same book on Amazon with reviews,
ratings, and availability to purchase it. The focus on the application is to store cookie information
that will include what bookstore the user was in when they took this picture so when the user
purchases it on Amazon we will be able to transfer a percentage of the funds to the local brick
and mortar store as a “thank you” for advertising the book and helping the user find it.
